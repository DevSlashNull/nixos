# nixos

This is my repository for things related to NixOS.

Below are some notes I took for my successful attempt (first try!) at
installing NixOS on a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon (6th Generation), including
successfully dual booting with an existing Windows 10 Pro installation. Note
that I have not used Linux extensively, nor do I have much hands-on
experience with disk partitioning/formatting, or other lower-level Linux
system admin tools, so some of the information relies heavily on other guides
that described exactly what to do. I hope this information helps another newbie like myself in the future!

TODO: once the dust settles, commit my configuration.nix file in this repo
